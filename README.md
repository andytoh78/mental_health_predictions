# **Mental Health Predictions**

Welcome to the 2024 Kaggle Playground Series! We plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting an approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month.

Your Goal: Your goal is to use data from a mental health survey to explore factors that may cause individuals to experience depression.

## **Evaluation**

Submissions are evaluated using Accuracy Score.

## **Dataset**

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Depression Survey/Dataset for Analysis dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.
